My take on a Philips Hue library

This started out as a clean up of the phue library, but then I decided to
rewrite it from the ground up.  I don't know if this is better, but it is
certainly simpler to me.  I am building my home automation on this library,
so I'll have a better feel of what to change in a few days.
